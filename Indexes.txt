My application uses two indexes that are initalized in the expense schema in order to optimize the mongo queries that I have.

My first index is on the expense attribute date which is one of two attributes the application filters on. 
Because there is a start and end date, the aggregate that gets the corresponding expenses is a range query. 
This would definitely benefit from an index. 
For example, when a user applies filters using a start and end date, or when generating reports for a specific period, 
this index allows MongoDB to efficiently look for only the relevant expenses without performing a full collection lookup. 
It's especially useful in the report aggregates that I have.

My second index is on the expense attribute of category (the category associated with an expense) which is extremely important for 
CRUD operations of the web page because all the expenses are grouped by category. 
The category index optimizes queries that retrieve all expenses for a specific category. 
This index ensures that MongoDB can quickly locate expenses belonging to a category, without scanning unrelated data. 
Most of the functionality of the app uses the category-expense relationship so this index is important.
